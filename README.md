# Automatized-Wall-Painting-Drone

![Idea Description](https://github.com/BAILOOL/Automatized-Wall-Painting-Drone/blob/master/Extra%20Files/Idea.jpg)


This project aims to develop an Automatized Wall Painting Drone that is able to draw pre-decided images on a wall on an automatized basis without human interaction apart from the picture input. Apart from saving human lives the proposed drone is expected to have higher efficiency, cheaper cost and safer to the surroundings compared to the original way of conducting painting jobs on tall buildings.
